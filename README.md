## Nikolai Meijer's Magnificent Awesome Portfolio

It took me a long time to conceptualize a portfolio that represented myself because there was so much that I wanted to include, so many design styles I wanted to follow and I realized the best way to show all that off was to stick with simplicity. By using a lot of white space, my content, my work can be better accentuated as negative space. With lots of white space, when my bright designs are on screen the eyes are drawn straight to them.

That lead me to where I am now. A lot of time wasted, a lot of time misused, and a lot of time spend doing nothing.

## The Concept

Everytime I create work I am proud of it comes from nothing. That long period leading up to creating my work, which comes out in an explosion of sudden creativity, is what helps make my work stand out. It's spontaneous, it's simple, and it's something out of nothing. 

I built my website concept from that exact philosophy. Something out of nothing. My portfolio site focuses on emphasizing work surrounded by space. Leaving nothing to look at but work. I don't like the idea of including a photograph in my portfolio. That is not my work, it's just me. I create the work on the site. I created a logo out of my name. An overused format and in the future will likely be renewed and changed, but stringing together the beginnings of my first and last names brings my identity into it. I am Nikolai Meijer. I am NM.

## Note from the Creator

Please enjoy. It is not perfect, but you can use imperfection to catch the eye, and my work is human. My work is imperfect. It will never be perfect because it can always get better, as will I.
